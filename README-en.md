# MTP(Morse code Translation)0.3 

### What is MTP 0.3

MTP 0.3 is a program which can translate the morse code.

and it is the third generation now.

### How to use MTP 0.3

well,it's very easy ,Although the instructions are chinese now.

(I think i will translate it into English someday)

1. run the program
2. after the first instructions were given,input the Separator. and press "enter"
3. after the second instructions were given,input the file name which contains the Morse code needing to be translated.and press"enter".
4. if you don't want to re-input the separator and  file name. input n  and press the enter. otherwise,input y,and press enter 
and you will repeat step 1~3
5. the result will be demonstrated on the screen. and you can just kill the program after getting the result.

#### an example

in the test.txt :
...././.-../.-../---/
--(test.txt end)

first,input / press "enter"

second,input test.txt  press "enter"

less than 1 second(probably),the translation was completed!

### Cautions and tips

DO **not** input any other characters when you are inputing separator!

using the . as Di(short signal),and the - as Da(long signal).

if there is some space between the separator and the morse code, it will be OK! don't worry!

if there is some characters between the separator and the morse code, well....,i think the translation will **go wrong**
